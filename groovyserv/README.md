# GROOVYSERV

This Docker image executes a `groovyserver` instance and exposes
`groovyclient` in the user's available `$PATH`.To build this image,
once you are in the `rpi-java` directory you have to:

- Execute `./build.sh`

## About Groovyserv

Groovyserv (https://github.com/kobo/groovyserv) makes Groovy execution
faster because it starts up a new JVM and executes new Groovy
executions in that JVM.
